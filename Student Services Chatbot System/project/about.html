            <h2>About the Student Services Chatbot</h2>
            <p>The Student Services Chatbot is a project designed to improve communication between university students and administration by providing an automated system that responds to common student inquiries in real-time.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The mission of this chatbot system is to provide fast, accurate, and convenient answers to student questions, improving efficiency and enhancing the overall student experience. It reduces the workload on university staff by handling repetitive inquiries like admissions, schedules, and event information.</p>
            
            <h3>Technology Used</h3>
            <p>This chatbot utilizes cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to queries. The chatbot is integrated with the university’s database systems to offer real-time updates and accurate information. We’ve built the chatbot using platforms such as Google Dialogflow for NLP and JavaScript frameworks for a smooth, interactive web interface.</p>
